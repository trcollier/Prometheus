### How to Use These Scripts

#### For Standalone Scripts (`.sh` files)
Most scripts in this directory are designed to be run directly.

1.  **Make the script executable:** Before running a script for the first time, you need to give it execute permissions.
    ```bash
    chmod +x your_script_name.sh
    ```
2.  **Run the script:**
    ```bash
    ./your_script_name.sh [arguments]
    ```

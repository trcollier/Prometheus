# Prometheus Scripting Workbench

*My personal repository of daily scripts, helpers, and automation tidbits.*

### About This Repository

This repository is my personal collection of scripts, functions, and code snippets created to solve everyday problems, automate repetitive tasks, and capture useful commands I encounter during my work.

Think of it as a digital scratchpad or a workbench for code. You'll find everything from one-liner `awk` commands to more complex Bash or Python scripts. These are often created on-the-fly and are saved here for future reference.

### How This Repo is Organized

To keep things from getting messy, I try to organize scripts into directories based on their **language or primary function**.
